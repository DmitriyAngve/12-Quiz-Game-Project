# 12-Quiz-Game-Project

In this base application I was using JSON object to drive a dynamic quiz game.

Questions are stored in json file. Fetched data iterated through and looped through, created a JavaScript object and rendered out game.

Practice in connecting to a JSON file and rearranging the JSON data. Also a practice for loading the DOM.

Unpretentious style included!
